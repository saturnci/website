  <h1>How I became a minor Ruby celebrity</h1>

    <p>
      I'm a nosy person. I always want to know everyone else's personal business.
      So whenever someone I follow online shares something about their personal background, I eagerly eat it right up.
      I'm writing this post in case you, dear reader, are nosy just like I am, and you want to know some of <i>my</i> personal business.
    </p>

    <p>
      First off, in case you've never heard of me me, here's an introduction.
      My name is Jason Swett. I'm the host of the <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/">Code with Jason Podcast</a>,
      a <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/articles/">blogger</a>,
      an occasional conference speaker,
      the former organizer of a conference called Sin City Ruby,
      the author of a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Rails-Testing-Tools-Principles/dp/B0DJRLK93M">Professional Rails Testing</a>
      and the author of what I assume must be one of the world's very few <i>snail mail</i> programming newsletters, <a href="https://www.nonsensemonthly.com/">Nonsense Monthly</a>.
      I'm also the creator of a continuous integration platform called <a href="https://www.saturnci.com/">SaturnCI</a>,
      a competitor to tools like CircleCI and GitHub Actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks to my relative eminence in the Ruby community, I've occasionally
      enjoyed certain career benefits. For example, when I used to do
      consulting work, I was able to win engagements that were easy, lucrative
      and fun. Sometimes I was able to get paid as much as $500/hr just for
      having a relaxed one-on-one conversation with a CTO or VPE over a video
      call. My minor celebrity status has also occasionally helped me get very
      good full-time jobs, and in addition to the monetary benefits, the work
      I've done has also provided me with wonderful friendships and interesting
      experinces all over the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be fair, I do feel compelled to add that being well-known in the Ruby
      community has not helped me with freelancing or job seeking quite as much
      as one might expect. I've found that in order to get jobs and consulting
      clients I've still sometimes had to work surprisingly hard and for
      somewhat disappointing results. But on the occasions when my reputation
      has paid off, it has usually paid off big. There's no question that all
      the work has been worth it. Here's how I did what I did. But first: why?
      Why did I want to build a reputation in the Ruby community?
    </p>

    <h2>Why I did all this</h2>

    <p>
      For many years I've wanted to build an online business. I've been working
      toward this objective since, believe it or not, 2008. I've had many
      failures and also some small successes. One small success I had was a
      product I built in 2011, scheduling software for hair salons. This was a
      success in the sense that it made more than zero dollars, but a failure
      in the sense that I worked on it for five years and never made more than
      about $500/month of revenue.
    </p>

    <h2>The two-part key to achieving prominence</h2>

    <p>
      Freelancing requires clients. Getting clients requires sales and
      marketing. Generally speaking, the stronger your sales and marketing, the
      better your clients, and the bigger your paychecks. I wanted those big
      paychecks, and I learned that speaking and writing are good ways to
      market yourself as a freelancer, so that's what I began doing. In 2018 I
      created
      <a href="http://codewithjason.com/">codewithjason.com</a>
      where I mostly wrote about Rails testing. At the same time I began
      speaking at conferences.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I first started trying to speak at conferences, I took a "spray and
      pray" approach. I didn't limit myself to just Ruby conferences. I
      submitted talk proposals to every conference I could find. At first none
      of my proposals got accepted, and then a whole bunch got accepted at
      once. During a nine-month period spanning 2018 and 2019 I spoke in St.
      Louis, Little Rock, Nashville, Omaha, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, and
      India. I found that speaking at conferences was not just a good way to be
      seen as an authority but also a good way to meet "high-profile"
      people in the software industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      So as of 2018 I was both blogging and speaking at conferences. In order
      to increase my footprint even more, in August of 2018 I started a
      podcast. I didn't know if podcasting was going to be for me, so as a
      low-commitment experiment I started a podcast called the Ruby Testing
      Podcast, which fit my existing theme of writing and speaking mostly on
      the topic of Rails testing. To my surprise, I was actually able to get
      both guests and listeners. I even got Kent Beck on the show.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was so encouraged with how well the Rails Testing Podcast went that I
      decided to start a different, broader podcast called Rails with Jason,
      which I later broadened again to just
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/">Code with Jason</a>.
      Just like speaking at conferences, I found podcasting to be a great way
      to meet high-profile people who I otherwise would never meet. My Code
      with Jason Podcast guests have included people such as 
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/9478286-028-sandi-metz-author-of-poodr-with-special-guest-tj-stankus/">Sandi Metz</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/9478291-024-michael-hartl-author-of-the-ruby-on-rails-tutorial/">Michael Hartl</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/9478218-097-chris-oliver-creator-of-gorails/">Chris Oliver</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/13111400-187-sin-city-ruby-keynote-speaker-obie-fernandez/">Obie Fernandez</a>
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/16872442-253-dave-thomas-author-of-the-pragmatic-programmer-and-sin-city-ruby-2025-keynote-speaker/">Dave Thomas</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/10325716-139-david-heinemeier-hansson/">DHH</a>,
      the list goes on. People often ask me how I managed to get such
      high-profile guests. Occasionally I get a guest thanks to some sort of
      privileged connection, but most of the time, I just send the person a
      cold email and ask.
    </p>

    <h2>The backbone of my sales and marketing</h2>

    <p>
      At the same time I was doing all these things, I was building an email
      list and sending emails to my subscribers on a roughly weekly basis,
      something I still do to this day. I find it very valuable to have a list
      of people who are interested in hearing from me. That way, when I have
      something that I want to share with as many people as possible, I can
      send an email to my subscribers.
    </p>

    <h2>How I cemented myself as an authority</h2>

    <p>
      In 2019 I wrote a short ebook called <i>Rails Testing for Beginners</i>
      which I sold mainly by sharing it with my email list. Then in 2021 I
      rewrote the book and called it <i>The Complete Guide to Rails
      Testing</i>. Most recently, in 2024, I rewrote the book again and called it
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Rails-Testing-Tools-Principles/dp/B0DJRLK93M">Professional Rails Testing</a>.
      Unlike my first two books which were exclusively ebooks, 
      <i>Professional Rails Testing</i> also has a print version.
      It's quite possible that I'll do yet another rewrite and create a second edition
      of <i>Professional Rails Testing</i>, but for I'm currently focused on
      other projects, specifically <a href="https://www.saturnci.com/">SaturnCI</a>,
      so for the foreseeable future I don't intend to prioritize any such
      writing projects.
