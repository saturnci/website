  <h1>What is Docker?</h1>

  <p>
    All programs have dependencies.
    In order to run a Ruby program on your computer, for example, you have to have Ruby installed.
    And very likely, you need not just Ruby but some Ruby gems, a JavaScript runtime like Node, a database client.
  </p>

  <p>
    The "old" way of getting these dependencies on your computer is to install them manually.
    There are problems with this way of doing it, though.
    First of all, how do you know which dependencies need to be installed, and which versions of them?
    Sometimes someone has created a list of dependencies in a <code>README</code> file which can be followed,
    which can help, although such lists are of course subject to being erroneous or out-of-date.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're lucky, someone has created a script which automatically installs your program's dependencies for you.
    But such a script is not infallible.
    It can blow up partway through, leaving your environment in a partially-set-up state and leaving you
    with the task of figuring out where and how to pick back up.
    It's also possible that the environment you're running the script on (your computer) is an environment
    that that script has never run on before and is not compatible with the script.
  </p>

  <p>
    What's more, the dependencies of one program can conflict with the dependencies of another.
    What if one program requires PostgreSQL 18 and another requires PostgreSQL 16?
  </p>

    These are the problems that Docker addresses. How?
    Loosely speaking, Docker makes a new computer inside your computer.
    This "inner machine" is isolated from the rest of your machine.
    It has its own operating system, its own filesystem, its own memory, its own disk space, its own everything.
    (Actually, not its own <i>everything</i>, but for present purposes, we need not concern ourselves with this detail.)
    By creating a new, isolated machine inside your machine, a program's dependencies can be installed in a fresh,
    empty environment, free of any potential conflicts with other dependencies.
    In Docker language, this inner machine is called a <b>container</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    How does a Docker container work? How does it get created? What goes on it?
    You can give a container almost any specifications you choose.
    You can specify that you want the container to run Ubuntu, Debian, Arch or any other supported Linux distribution.
    From there, you can specify any dependencies that you want to be present on the container when it comes into existence.
    All this specification is done in something called a <code>Dockerfile</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    What exactly is a <code>Dockerfile</code>? Is it a setup script that gets run when the container first comes online?
    No, that would be no good.
    If a container's setup worked this way, the process would be susceptible to some of the same problems as a setup script
    that gets run on your regular computer, specifically the risk of the script halting partway through and leaving you stranded.
    So that's not how container setup works in Docker.
    Instead, container's setup works in a way that guarantees a container will always be created in a good state.
  </p>

  <p>
    How might this be achieved?
    By splitting the container setup process into two stages.
    First there's the stage where the setup script runs.
    Second, the outcome of that script run gets captured and saved.
    It's that saved outcome of the script that gets used to generate a container, not the script itself directly.
    The saved outcome is called an <b>image</b>.
    To put this all in Docker terms, a <code>Dockerfile</code> gets run which creates an image, and then
    a container gets generated from the image.
    A <code>Dockerfile</code> can get broken but an image can't, since an image will only be created if the <code>Dockerfile</code> runs successfully.
