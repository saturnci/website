    <p>
      I'm a nosy person. I always want to know everyone else's personal business.
      So whenever someone in the Ruby community (or anyone really) shares something about their personal background, I eagerly eat it right up.
      I've decided to share a personal post about myself because
      a) if I enjoy such posts, presumably other people do too,
      b) if you're interested in emulating some of the things I've done and getting some of the outcomes I've gotten, you can learn a bit about how I did what I did.
    </p>

    <p>
      First off, in case you've never me, here's an introduction.
      My name is Jason Swett. I'm the host of the <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/">Code with Jason Podcast</a>,
      a frequent conference speaker,
      the former organizer of a conference called Sin City Ruby,
      a prolific <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/articles/">blogger</a>,
      the author of a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Rails-Testing-Tools-Principles/dp/B0DJRLK93M">Professional Rails Testing</a>
      and the author of what I assume must be one of the world's very few snail mail programming newsletters, <a href="https://www.nonsensemonthly.com/">Nonsense Monthly</a>.
      I'm also the creator of a continuous integration platform called <a href="https://www.saturnci.com/">SaturnCI</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll briefly share how I got my start in programming and how I got into Ruby.
      I put my first website online around 1996, when I was 12 years old.
      My dad is also a programmer, and for a period of time he had his own business,
      which I worked for from ages 14-16 doing mostly Delphi programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2002 I began a Computer Science degree at Western Michigan University.
      During college, in parallel to working at a grocery store and other
      similar jobs, I tried as hard as I could to get a programming job even
      though I was woefully unqualified. Finally, in 2005, I found somebody who
      was dumb enough to hire me, and I've worked exclusively as a programmer
      ever since. I never bothered to finish my degree.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this first job they used PHP, a language I think is fair to
      characterize as "tolerable". Tolerate it I did for about six years until
      I started dabbling in other languages, like Ruby, Python and Lisp, which
      made me realize what I had been missing out on. Of the languages I tried
      I liked Ruby the best. In 2011 I decided to leave PHP behind and get a
      Ruby job. Around this same time I starting toying with the idea of
      becoming a full-time freelancer. My decision to go freelance was made a
      bit easier nine months into my first Ruby job, when I got fired. For the
      next ten years, on and off I worked as a freelancer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Freelancing requires clients. Getting clients requires sales and
      marketing. Generally speaking, the stronger your sales and marketing, the
      better your clients, and the bigger your paychecks. I wanted those big
      paychecks, and I learned that speaking and writing are good ways to
      market yourself as a freelancer, so that's what I began doing. In 2018 I
      created
      <a href="http://codewithjason.com/">codewithjason.com</a>
      where I mostly wrote about Rails testing. At the same time I began
      speaking at conferences.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I first started trying to speak at conferences, I took a "spray and
      pray" approach. I didn't limit myself to just Ruby conferences. I
      submitted talk proposals to every conference I could find. At first none
      of my proposals got accepted, and then a whole bunch got accepted at
      once. During a nine-month period spanning 2018 and 2019 I spoke in St.
      Louis, Little Rock, Nashville, Omaha, Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, and
      India. I found that speaking at conferences was not just a good way to be
      seen as an authority but also a good way to meet other "high-profile"
      people in the software industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      So as of 2018 I was both blogging and speaking at conferences. In order
      to increase my footprint even more, in August of 2018 I started a
      podcast. I didn't know if podcasting was going to be for me, so as a
      low-commitment experiment I started a podcast called the Ruby Testing
      Podcast, which fit my existing theme of writing and speaking mostly on
      Rails testing. To my mild surprise, I was actually able to get both
      guests and listeners. I even got Kent Beck on the show.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was so encouraged with how well the Rails Testing Podcast went that I
      decided to start a different, broader podcast called Rails with Jason,
      which I later broadened again to just
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/">Code with Jason</a>.
      Just like speaking at conferences, I found podcasting to be a great way
      to meet high-profile people as well. My Code with Jason Podcast guests
      have included people such as <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/9478283-032-test-desiderata-with-kent-beck-and-kelly-sutton/">Kent Beck</a> (again),
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/9478286-028-sandi-metz-author-of-poodr-with-special-guest-tj-stankus/">Sandi Metz</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/9478291-024-michael-hartl-author-of-the-ruby-on-rails-tutorial/">Michael Hartl</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/9478218-097-chris-oliver-creator-of-gorails/">Chris Oliver</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/13111400-187-sin-city-ruby-keynote-speaker-obie-fernandez/">Obie Fernandez</a>
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/16872442-253-dave-thomas-author-of-the-pragmatic-programmer-and-sin-city-ruby-2025-keynote-speaker/">Dave Thomas</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/podcast/10325716-139-david-heinemeier-hansson/">DHH</a>,
      the list goes on. People often ask me how I managed to get such
      high-profile guests. Occasionally I get a guest thanks to some sort of
      privileged connection, but most of the time, I just send the person a
      cold email and ask.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time I was doing all these things, I was building an email
      list and sending emails to my subscribers on a roughly weekly basis,
      something I still do to this day. I find it very valuable to have a list
      of people who are generally interested in hearing from me. That way, when
      I have something that I want to share with as many people as possible in
      as attention-grabbing way as possible, I can send an email to my
      subscribers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2019 I wrote a short ebook called
      Rails Testing for Beginners which I sold mainly by sharing it with my
      email list. Then in 2021 I rewrote the book and called it The Complete
      Guide to Rails Testing. Most recently, in 2024, I rewrote the book again
      and called it
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Rails-Testing-Tools-Principles/dp/B0DJRLK93M">Professional Rails Testing</a>.
