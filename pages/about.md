  <h1>About SaturnCI</h1>

  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      What do you want out of a test runner?
      You want it to do basically one thing:
      when your test suite fails, you want it to tell you what failed.
      Duh!
      Most of the CI products on the market, such as CircleCI, GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, Jenkins and TeamCity, don't do a particularly great job of this.
      Nay, they do a <i>spectacularly bad</i> job of this.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a test suite fails, most CI products make you dig to find what went wrong.
      They make you sift through parallel runners and then scroll through logs.
      You have to manually look with your eyeballs to find the signal in the noise.
      Several times a day.
      Why?
      Aren't computers supposed to automate things like this for us?
    </p>

    <h3>A CI platform based on common sense</h3>

    <p>
      SaturnCI is built on the idea that things you frequently need to do should be easy.
      Finding failure messages,
      navigating among test runs,
      filtering test runs,
      diagnosing problems,
      setting up your project---all these things should be easy.
      And the UI should be fast, intuitive and pleasant to use.
    </p>
