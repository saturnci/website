  <h2>What is SaturnCI and why was it created?</h2>

  <p>
    I'm Jason Swett, the creator of SaturnCI.
    I built SaturnCI because I was frustrated with existing CI tools like CircleCI, GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, TeamCity and Jenkins.
  </p>

  <h3>Don't hide the most important thing from me!</h3>

  <p>
    What frustrated me about these other products?
    When a test run fails, I want to know exactly one thing: <i>what went wrong</i>.
    You would think that CI tools would make this easy. But no! Most of leading tools make you <i>dig</i> to find the failure message.
    You have to click around to different pages, scroll through logs, and manually scan log output, with your eyeballs, to separate signal from noise.
    Why? Why are these tools making us do all this manual work that a computer could automate?
    I find it stupid, quite frankly. In fact, I'm personally offended by it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I created SaturnCI because I wanted a CI product that followed the rules of common sense.
    Since I know that the failure message is what you want to see when a test suite fails, that's the first thing SaturnCI shows you.
    No digging, no scrolling, no manual searching with your eyeballs.
    SaturnCI automates the things a computer should automate.
  </p>

  <h3>Fuck executable YAML!</h3>

  <p>
    Another thing that I <i>hate hate hate</i> about most CI products is the concept of configuration-as-quasi-executable-YAML.
    What's even worse is that most YAML configurations also contain a non-trivial amount of shell scripting.
    I think the fact that as an industry we've arrived at shell-scripting-inside-of-YAML as the de-facto standard for CI configuration is...what's the expression?
    Oh yeah, FUCKING INSANE.
  </p>

  <p>
    So if SaturnCI doesn't use executable YAML for configuration, what does it use?
    It doesn't use a product-specific configuration format like other CI products do.
    In order to learn CircleCI's configuration for example, you have to rely solely on CircleCI's own documentation,
    and any third-party CircleCI documentation that may happen to exist, which, in my experience, tends to be low in volume and, sadly, often unclear and out-of-date.
    That's why SaturnCI takes advantage of the existing technology of Docker Compose.
    That way you don't have to rely solely on the SaturnCI documentation.
    You have all the world's Docker documentation to rely on.
    And of course, many developers already know <a href="./what-is-docker.html">Docker</a> and Docker Compose, and if you're one of them, you'll hardly have to learn anything new at all.
  </p>

  <h3>Designed specifically for Rails + RSpec</h3>

  <p>
    A big part of the reason the leading CI products lack seemingly commonsense features is the fact that they're so generic.
    They give you more or less a blank canvas on which you can paint whatever you want.
    But that means that the product can't make any assumptions about what you want.
  </p>

  <p>
    SaturnCI is designed explicitly and exclusively (for now) for Ruby on Rails and RSpec.
    This means that SaturnCI can make a lot of assumptions about your project's structure, shifting the setup burden from you to the computer and allowing SaturnCI to interpret your test results in a way that would be very difficult for a technology-agnostic CI product.
